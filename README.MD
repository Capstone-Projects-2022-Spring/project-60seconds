# 60 Seconds 
## Project Overview
60 Seconds is a web-based application used for recording short, daily audio segments, and will be available for both mobile devices, and desktop/laptop computers via a web browser. A user will record daily audio segments, the maximum sum of recording time is 60 seconds. Their daily recording time is ‘pooled’ similar to ‘swipes’ on Tinder. Once the user exceeds a total recording time sum of 60 seconds for that day, they will be unable to record more content. A user WILL be able to record multiple segments a day, so long as the sum of their playtime does not exceed 60 seconds.
